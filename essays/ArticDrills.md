The arctic is a crumbling part of the world that holds the secrets of the past of earth. Countries across the world are eager to explore the icy tundra in the world and grab everything they can from the tundra. The arctic is constantly being used for new ideas and new explorations are launched often. The artic ice is one of the oldest parts of the planet and has fascinated scientists for years as the drive to understand the ice is always at the top of their minds. The effects of drilling for oil in the arctic are not worth the risks and should be banned because it causes the destruction of the environment, animals and ecosystems, and our perception of climate change. 

The first reason why drilling in the arctic for oil is the damage that drilling causes to the environment. One of the ways that drilling for oil damages the environment is by destroying the coral and other plants that are found in the water. Drilling does this by disrupting either the plants themselves or the area around them which can make it difficult to survive by not getting the resources that are needed. The drills can directly hit the plants and the coral by ripping them to sheds and removing them as they block the drill or by drilling the land around the plants and displacing the roots and part of the coral colony. Drilling can also destroy plants and coral by taking away resources. One of the ways that this can happen is if the drill is blocking the amount of light that the corals are getting and stopping the amount that they can grow. Another way is by impeding the water movement and current around the corals, when this happens the coral can face damage from the speed from the water currents along with any potential residue in the water. 

The next way that drilling for oil can affect the environment is by limiting the amount of information that can be learned from the ice. The way that this happens is by drilling in the ice, the drills destroy years' worth of carbon dating. This information is very important to scientists because it helps them date time periods on the earth and understand why certain events happen on earth like the ice ages. When destroying the ice, it also destroys the carbon that has been trapped in the ice for sometimes millions of years that scientists use for the carbon dating process. In some rare cases drilling can also disrupt or even destroy evidence of animals like bones of larger fossils.  

The next way that drilling for oil harms the environment is by creating and producing oil spills. This is harmful to the environment in the arctic because when oil is spilled it can permanently damage both animals and the environment. When animals are affected, they can cause problems to how the animal moves, when a penguin for example gets oil on them, they have issues moving their wings and either struggle with swimming or can’t swim. Oil spills can damage the environment by making it impossible to hunt or be active in the area, it can also permanently damage the life in the ocean and make it impossible for scientists to study in the part for the ocean. Oil drilling can also take away ice and trap animals and slowly affect them and as well as the ocean can take away area for scientists to operate in. 

The second way that drilling for oil in the arctic is harmful and shouldn't be allowed is because it causes harm to animals. Drilling causes damage for animals by damaging the environment that they live and interact with which can remove or displace animals. When drilling it destroys the area that animals live in most of the time, when thinking about animals like polar bears the drill needs to go through the ice to reach the oil, when this happens it in some circumstances can split the ice and break massive chunks free. Another way that drilling animals can be over where they feed or hunt, when drilling in the water seals get affected along with penguins easily. This has been a fear of environmentalists for quite a while, according to Dan Joling “Royal Dutch Shell PLC has spent more than $7 billion on Arctic drilling and was dogged at every regulatory level by environmentalists, who feared a spill in the climate would be difficult to clean up and devastating to polar bears, walruses, seals and other wildlife.pg 1” Drilling affects these animals the most when it comes to food because when drilling in the water if fish swim in the area of the drill normally the sight, sound, and damage that the drill display normally scares them off. When animals like seals and penguins go to their normal hunting grounds, they can themselves be damaged by the drill if they get to close or they will find no food and because of how food already is in the arctic it can be a death sentence. 

Another way that drilling can affect the animals in the arctic is by destroying the breeding area for animals. When drilling in the arctic it can lead to conditions that force migration to occur when having their kids, this can be brought on by low food in an area or lack of an area to lay eggs. When drilling for oil it can lead to crack ice, when this happens it breaks off pieces of ice from the ice shelf and other platforms when this happens the area that animals can lay eggs on is reduced. Animals facing this kind of problem in result of this end up moving to a different area to lay their eggs, this can be a problem because they are potentially leaving to an area that is substantially worse in terms of food, with no guarantee of more room to produce there young. This process will continue because as the animals move needing more ice to lay eggs on, the company's move needs more ice to drill on. One of the largest planned drillings in the arctic expeditions was cancelled by shell due in part to environmentalists concerns over the damage to the environment, according to Oil Spill Intelligence Report “As one of the largest corporations to pursue Arctic oil and gas, Shell’s retreat from a $7 billion gamble sends an important message: Arctic drilling is too dangerous and too expensive and should be stopped altogether pg. 1” this was one of the companies that had to deal with the environmental groups and eventually shell gave way and agreed to stop. 

The next way that drilling for oil in the arctic can affect animals is by destroying the environment where the animals are naturally living. This can be harmful to animals by destroying the environment that they are comfortable in and know the best. This can be a problem to the animals because it forces the animals to move to a new spot and to take risks getting to an area that they don’t know and will have to learn again; the animals will not be sure what the area offers to them. Because of this the animals may not be able to gather food properly or be able to survive in their unfamiliar environment because there maybe predators in the new environment. All of this can affect animals by giving them situations where they can’t live in the new environment because they won’t be able to survive for a long time without being hunted and pushed out of their new environment and repeating the process. 

The third way that drilling for oil in the arctic is harmful is it directly effects climate change. One of the ways that drilling for oil affects climate change is that when operating a drill, it takes quite a lot of fuel to make it work. According to New Scientist “Globally, 2020 was the second-warmest year on record, with a mean temperature 1.2°C above the pre-industrial average. The culprits are carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels and land use changes that reduce Earth's ability to draw down greenhouse gases.” When using fuel, you are releasing fossil fuels into the air and when you start to release fossil fuels it leads to the greenhouse effect. In short, the heat from fossil fuels gets trapped in the earth's atmosphere and it creates a hotter temperature globally. The more drills that are operating and the more drills there are in general increasing the amount of fossil fuels in the atmosphere and increasing the amount of greenhouse gases that warming the planet. Greenhouse gases are one of the main contributors to climate change on the planet and one of the easiest to produce. 

Another way that drilling in the arctic can affect climate change is that when drilling in the ice it can lead to destruction of ice and affect sea levels. When drilling in the arctic the drill produces an insane amount of heat, this can affect climate change because it heats up the ice and has the ice melt. When too much ice melts it creates a massive amount of water that slowly but surely raises the sea levels around the planet. This is a major problem because accroding to Bill Eric “In recent years, public concern over climate change has also grown as average temperatures increase, glaciers continue to melt, oceans rise, and weather events like hurricanes and wildfires become more frequent and more extreme pg.1”, with the higher levels of drilling the more amount of water will be put back into the ocean and they will only continue to rise. Another way that drilling affects sea levels is when drilling it can break apart ice and if the ice contains gases from a long time ago when it melts it releases these gases and puts it directly in the atmosphere. Along with melting and releasing gases from the ice, the ice is now mobile and can destroy things like the drill which leads to other effects on the climate.  

The third point on how drilling for oil in the arctic can affect scientists' study of climate change is by destroying the area for scientists to measure climate change. This can happen by drilling into the ice and destroying the ice so it can’t be used for mining and drilling for things like carbon dating the earth. Carbon dating the earth is one of the main ways that scientists look at the earths past and predict the future based on the history on earth. They do this by looking at the time before the major ice ages on the planet and looking to see if there is a similar comparison and if they need to be concerned. Another way that drilling for oil is bad for climate change is when drilling for oil in the ice they can release gas and put it in the atmosphere. This happens because over the history of the earth gas is absorbed into the ice and the ocean and overtime it freezes over and years later when drilling occurs it can release gas into the air which affects scientist because they can’t use that gas to carbon date because it is now gone. 

While drilling for oil in the arctic promises an abundance of oil its destructive potential is devastating. It is a dangerous practice that can be exceedingly difficult if not impossible to monitor and maintain during the drilling. If the drilling fails it can lead to the destruction of the environment, animal populations, and how we perceive climate change on earth.
